Lemma subgroup_caracterization_backward :
  forall (x: HNN), `[HNN_b] @ x == x @ `[HNN_b] -> inSubgroup genH' x.
Admitted.

(* proof plan:
   - find an equivalent presentation of G that is convergent.
   - prove that the resulting HNN presentation is convergent.
   - if b x == x b, then reduced (b x) == reduced (x b)
     so: reduced (b x) = reduced (x b)
     if x is not in H:
      reduced (b x) = b (reduced x)
      reduced (x b) = (reduced x) b
     so b (reduced x) = (reduced x) b
     (reduced x) doesnt contain any b, so (reduced x) = [] = (reduced e)
     so x = e, thus x in H: boom, explosion

   technical difficulties:
   - the standard convergent presentation of G might not be finite
   - `reduced` is not computable if the presentation is not finite
   - need to introduce the notions of an equivalent presentation
